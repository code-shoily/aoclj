# aoclj -- AdventOfCode with Clojure

[Advent of Code](http://www.adventofcode.com) puzzle solutions in Clojure (2015 - 2024).

## Commands

* To run a solution: `lein run solve <year> <day>` Will display error if the day is not solved yet
* To generate artifacts to solve a new problem:  `lein run gen <year> <day>` Will not over-write if file existed.
* To update the READMEs with latest progress/stars: `lein run update-stats`
* I've tried to document important pieces of the code, you can
view the documentation in literate programming style with the command `lein marg -m`

## Progress
### :star: 209/500 :dart: 291 :trophy: 105/250 :dart: 145
