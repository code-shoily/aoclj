;; ----------------------------- Priority Queue(ish)
;; We are for now using `priority-map` because somehow that was included
;; with this project as dep.
;; One option would be to do it with Java's PriorityQueue but wanted to
;; stay in immutable land.
;;
;; TODO: Refactor this.
;;
;; Initially had [task task] as the [key value] for the map but upon
;; unlocking `part-2`, I realized that there is a task value associated
;; with it and that agrees with the task name sorting order.
